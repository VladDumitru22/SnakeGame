# SnakeGame

## Description
This is a simple Snake game built with Python, designed to demonstrate fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, especially inheritance. The game uses the built-in turtle library for rendering the graphics and handling basic animations.
## Features
- Player controls the snake using arrow keys
- Snake grows when it eats food
- Game ends on collision with the wall or itself
- Basic scoring system
- Clean object-oriented code structure
- Persistent high score saved in a text file

## Structure
The program is organized into several classes:
- Snake: handles the movement and growth of the snake
- Food: generates food at random locations
- Scoreboard: Displays the current score and updates the high score in a file

## OOP concepts
- Encapsulation: Each class encapsulates its own data and logic.
- Inheritance: classes inheriting from Turtle
- Abstraction: Internal logic is hidden; interaction is done through clear method interfaces
